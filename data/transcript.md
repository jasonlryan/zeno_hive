Based on the conversations on June 24th, the detailed requirements for HIVE 3.0 center around transforming Zeno's cultural intelligence capabilities into an always-on, AI-powered operating system that moves from trend identification to automated creative activation.
Here's a breakdown of the requirements:

1. Core Vision and Goal
   •
   End-to-End System: The primary goal is to build a comprehensive, end-to-end system that covers trend spotting, ideation, and content creation. This means identifying rising cultural moments, generating ideas based on brand knowledge, allowing human selection of ideas, and then automatically building creative assets for distribution.
   •
   Predictive Cultural Intelligence: The system must include a predictive aspect that can prove the trajectory of trends and provide metric output on how fast something is surging. It needs to identify trends that have "staying power" rather than fleeting ones.
   •
   Proprietary and Scalable: HIVE 3.0 aims to be an ownable and scalable proprietary brand intelligence system that augments Talkwalker, providing Zeno with faster insight, stronger IP, and a cultural edge. It should be modular and allow for future expansion.
2. Data Sources & Ingestion
   •
   Peak Metrics API Integration: The system will primarily integrate with the Peak Metrics API starting July 1st, as it offers more comprehensive data streams than Talkwalker's API. This includes threads data, TikTok data, Discord data (public channels), and global messaging platforms.
   •
   Enhanced Data Metrics: Peak Metrics is expected to provide crucial data points such as velocity (speed of engagement, volume of posts), engagement metrics, and trend trajectory.
   •
   Multi-Platform Monitoring: The system needs to scrape from a wide range of sources beyond traditional social listening, including TikTok, Reddit, YouTube, Instagram, podcasts, Substack, forums, news outlets, and broader web channels. This also includes comprehensive mention tracking across text, image, audio, and video.
   •
   Brand Mentions vs. Cultural Moments: The system should be able to differentiate between pure brand mentions and broader cultural moments, and then match the two to derive relevant insights.
   •
   Existing Tool Integration: While augmenting Talkwalker, HIVE 3.0 should also consider integrating data from Zeno's existing custom GPTs and beta platforms like TikTok insights.
3. Core Functionalities
   •
   Signal Detection (Layer 1): Identify emerging cultural moments using velocity-based scoring algorithms.
   •
   Intelligence & Ideation (Layer 2):
   ◦
   AI-powered analysis: Generate relevant creative concepts based on trend data and brand knowledge.
   ◦
   Customization: Allow for custom models or GPTs to be trained on specific brand voice guidelines, historical performance, and audience intelligence.
   ◦
   Relevance Scoring: Provide a mechanism to score concepts for their fit and relevance to a specific brand or to disqualify ideas.
   ◦
   Concept Generation: Produce multiple ideas and translate them into messages.
   ◦
   Predictive Messaging: Assess how messaging might resonate with different brand personas or segments. This could integrate with Zeno's existing synthetic audience personas.
   ◦
   Unified GPTs: Connect disparate custom GPT tools into a cohesive "AIic system".
   •
   Creative Asset Generation (Layer 3):
   ◦
   Campaign Plan Generation: Generate comprehensive campaign plans, including integrated plans, based on content strategy and themes.
   ◦
   Automated Asset Briefing & Optimization: Automatically brief, generate, and optimize various content assets.
   ◦
   Multi-Format Output: Produce assets for diverse media, including social posts, paid media, and larger hero assets for integrated campaigns.
   ◦
   Channel-Agnostic Content: Ideally, generate long-form, channel-agnostic content that can be atomized and adapted for specific native formats across different mediums.
   ◦
   Data-Backed Creative: Utilize historical performance data of earned and paid media to inform future content, suggest appropriate outlets, and revise headlines for higher performance.
   ◦
   Asset Evaluation: Include a scoring algorithm for assets to evaluate their potential performance across historical data, channel, and specific persona/segment axes.
   •
   Distribution Intelligence (Layer 4):
   ◦
   Feedback Loop: Crucially, the system must incorporate the actual performance of posted creative back into the system for continuous learning and improvement.
   ◦
   Proof of Concept: Provide metrics and data to demonstrate the effectiveness of HIVE-generated assets for pitching to new clients.
   ◦
   Internal Learning & Insights: Facilitate intelligent briefings, sharing of strategic insights, and real-time metrics/campaign data for internal learnings.
4. User Experience & Integration
   •
   Unified Interface: A key requirement is to minimize steps and log-ins by integrating multiple GPTs and data sources into a unified interface or "one-stop shop" for ideation and output development.
   •
   Collaborative Tool: Brilliant Noise will build a simple collaborative tool for team input and idea logging.
   •
   Teams Channel Integration: Future integration with Microsoft Teams channels is desired for prompting data directly within those channels.
5. Human-in-the-Loop
   •
   Strategic Checkpoints: Human review and oversight remain mandatory at critical decision points, including idea curation and final asset sign-off, to ensure brand safety, creative quality control, and contextual judgment.
   •
   Performance Learning: Human feedback loops should contribute to improving AI accuracy.
6. Scalability & Operational Requirements
   •
   Unified Platform Approach: Zeno prefers a unified platform approach (one HIVE that can be adapted per client) rather than building a separate HIVE for each client, to improve efficiency and maintainability.
   •
   Modular Workflow Automation: The automation scope should be modular, covering detection → idea → review → asset → publish.
   •
   Documentation: Brilliant Noise will create a framework document for team review and feedback.
   •
   Input for Development: Zeno will provide examples of existing HIVE outputs, campaign results, historical campaign formats, and creative templates to inform the development of layers 2 and 3.
   •
   Stakeholder Involvement: Zeno intends to involve creative directors in upcoming phases.
