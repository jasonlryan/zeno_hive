1. Zeno's Existing Manual 11-Step Workflow
This workflow is described as a multi-step manual process that creates bottlenecks, preventing Zeno from capitalizing on fleeting cultural opportunities.
•
Overviews and Descriptions:
◦
In the "Brief for HIVE 3.0" document, HIVE 3.0 is introduced as a platform that will "fundamentally restructure your content creation workflow—collapsing an 11-step manual process into a seamless, AI-enhanced system".
◦
The document includes a "Process Transformation Map" that visually outlines the "Current State: 11 discrete manual steps with sequential bottlenecks". These steps are listed as: Culture monitoring → Social listening/prediction → Brand prompts → Ideas generation → Human selection → Idea refinement → Creative prompts → Storyboarding → Human review → Production → Distribution & evaluation.
◦
Antony Mayfield presents a "manually made visualisation" of this 11-step process in the "Productizing AI and PR Processes" discussion, showing it as a linear flow from "Culture listening" to "Production" and "Distribution & evaluation". He refers to this as the "process transformation map".

◦
During the Kick Off call (June 17, 2025), Greg Tedesco refers to their "current like aI hive system" which is based on "listening engines and custom gpts" that alert them to relevant internet moments. Michael Brito clarifies that their previous "blanket email" for cultural updates had ceased, leading to teams seeking manual "hive support".
◦
In the Weekly Call (June 24, 2025), Michael Brito provides a walkthrough of Zeno's current HIVE setup, detailing how they use "TalkWalker dashboards plus co-pilot functionality". He explains that these co-pilots are "built natively within Talk Walker" using OpenAI for trend analysis and insight generation. He mentions limitations, such as the co-pilot only contextualizing data and providing summaries, with graphical data expected later. Nancy-Elizabeth Funez confirms this was their "very first one" and has been "revamped" with a focus on specific categories and trend trajectories. Michael also notes the limitation of 100-120 questions per month per user on these co-pilots. Greg Tedesco adds that they also use custom GPTs and are involved in a beta for TikTok insights to supplement Talkwalker.
2. Proposed AI-Enhanced / Future State Workflow
HIVE 3.0 aims to collapse the current manual process into a seamless, AI-enhanced system, maintaining human creativity while increasing speed and scale. It is envisioned as an "always-on, AI-powered operating system" and a "living platform-process hybrid".
•
Overviews and Descriptions:
◦
The "Brief for HIVE 3.0" describes the future state as a "fully-automated, human-in-the-loop workflow: detect trend → auto-ideate concepts → team review → system produces assets → publish & monitor".
◦
A "Process Transformation Map" outlines the "Future State" with integrated, parallel-processing system and strategic human touchpoints: "Stages 1-3: Automated cultural detection and brand-relevant filtering; Stage 4-5: AI-generated concepts with human curation; Stages 6-8: Automated creative development with strategic oversight; Stages 9-11: Human-approved asset production and intelligent distribution".
◦
The "V2 Brief for HIVE 3" specifies that HIVE 3.0 must be "Platform-agnostic & Always-On" (scraping various sources), "Predictive with Social Velocity Signals," and "Creative-Connected with Human-in-the-Loop". This includes a pipeline where a rising trend is identified, ideas are generated, strategists review, creative concepts are generated, strategists review again, and assets are prepared for delivery or publication. The "End-to-end automation ambition" is stated as: "detection → idea → review → asset → publish".
◦
The proposed system includes "Multi-modal asset creation (text, image, video concepts)".

During the Kick Off call (June 17, 2025), Greg Tedesco outlines the desired "end-to-end system" covering "trend spotting, ideation and content creation". He envisions an "always buzzing" system that identifies moments, generates ideas based on brand knowledge, and then "build assets for it" for social, paid, or integrated campaigns, with a human in the loop. Jessica Yust highlights the crucial "predictive aspect" for trend trajectory, seeking "metric output" to support data-driven decisions. Michael Brito introduces Peak Metrics API as the key data source for velocity and engagement metrics. Antony Mayfield emphasizes building a framework with "data as the input and the creative as output".
◦
In the Weekly Call (June 24, 2025), Michael Brito discusses the need for Peak Metrics API to provide enhanced data beyond TalkWalker's limitations, including threads, TikTok, and Discord data. He confirms that Peak Metrics API will be the only data source for MVP. Stuart Yeardsley, a Creative Director, provides a crucial perspective on the creative output, stating AI is about "coexistence" where "artistic intelligence married with artificial intelligence". He stresses that the system should focus on "real time response creative" and "news jacking," generating "prolific number of creative concepts quickly" rather than perfecting single outputs. Jason Ryan details the "human-in-the-loop" mechanism, explaining that a toggle could pause workflows at each stage for human review and refinement of prompts or output. Michael Brito also raises the strategic question of how pricing will align with the level of human intervention.
3. Brilliant Noise's Four-Layer Framework
Brilliant Noise proposed a four-layer framework to structure the HIVE 3.0 development, serving as a blueprint for the end-to-end cultural moment marketing platform.
•
Overviews and Descriptions:
◦
The framework consists of: Signal Detection, Intelligence/Ideation, Creative Asset Generation, and Distribution Intelligence.
◦
The "AI-Powered Cultural Marketing System Workflows" document explicitly details workflows within each of these four phases, including "Continuous Learning Loop" and "Automated Learning" across phases.
•
Discussion in Transcripts:
◦
The Weekly Call (June 24, 2025) is where Jason Ryan first presents this four-layer framework. He walks through each layer:
▪
Signal Detection: Involves "continuous monitoring, signal analysis, trend classification, alert generation" using data sources like Peak Metrics (for velocity, engagement, trend trajectory) and other platforms. It also distinguishes between "opportunistic quick-rising trends and slower-paced movements" and matching brand mentions with cultural moments.
▪
Intelligence/Ideation: Focuses on "AI-powered analysis" to generate "relevant creative concepts". This includes "connecting GPTs trained on brand voice," "relevance scoring" for brand fit, and "concept generation" for multiple ideas and message translation. Michael Brito adds the potential for synthetic audiences for persona-based resonance analysis. Jason discusses the idea of "scoring ideas" based on specific criteria to determine if they are worth pursuing.
▪
Creative Asset Generation: Discussed as creating "campaign plans" and specific "content assets" (text, image, video). Greg Tedesco suggests generating "channel agnostic" hero assets that can be atomized for different media. Michael Brito highlights integrating "historical data of performance" from earned or paid media to inform headline revisions and optimal placement. Jason proposes a "scoring algorithm" to evaluate assets against historical data, channel, and segment/persona.
▪
Distribution Intelligence: Focuses on "intelligent briefings, sharing strategic insights," and providing "real-time metrics and campaign data". The key is to "feed the metrics back into the system" for continuous improvement and "proof of concept" for clients.
◦
Brilliant Noise states their initial development focus will be on layers 2 & 3 (intelligence/ideation and creative asset generation).
◦
In the Weekly Check-in (July 1, 2025), Jason demonstrates a "new specification website" which organizes content around these four stages: "detection, ideation, creation, distribution". This website is intended for collaborative feedback on the workflow's "structure, process, [and] workflow".
