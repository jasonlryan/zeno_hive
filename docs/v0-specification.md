# HIVE 3.0 v0 Specification

## Documentation & Team Collaboration Platform

---

## Overview

HIVE 3.0 v0 is a simple web platform designed to surface our comprehensive documentation and enable team collaboration on specification refinement. This is **not** the full HIVE system - it's a specification workspace where the team can review, understand, and collaboratively define what we should build.

## Core Purpose

1. **Make Documentation Accessible**: Present all our research and specifications in a clean, navigable format
2. **Enable Team Collaboration**: Allow team members to comment, suggest, and refine the specifications
3. **Focus on WHAT to Build**: Help the team understand and shape the requirements before development begins
4. **Prevent Scope Creep**: Keep v0 simple and focused on specification, not implementation

## Target Users

- **Zeno Team Members**: Strategy, creative, account management, and technical teams
- **Stakeholders**: Leadership and decision-makers reviewing the HIVE 3.0 vision
- **External Collaborators**: Brilliant Noise team and other partners contributing to specifications

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Documentation (Week 1)

- Build basic documentation viewer
- Implement navigation and search
- Style with ZENO branding
- Test on mobile devices

### Phase 2: Area Breakdown (Week 2)

- Create 4 area overview pages
- Detail process workflows for each area
- Add visual process flows
- Connect to main documentation

### Phase 3: Collaboration Features (Week 3)

- Implement commenting system
- Add suggestion/discussion features
- Enable team member @mentions
- Create feedback aggregation views

### Phase 4: Refinement (Week 4)

- Gather team feedback on v0
- Refine based on usage patterns
- Prepare for transition to v1 development
- Document lessons learned for main build

## Success Metrics

### Usage Metrics

- **Team Engagement**: Number of active team members using the platform
- **Content Interaction**: Comments, suggestions, and discussions per section
- **Documentation Coverage**: Percentage of specifications reviewed by team
- **Consensus Building**: Number of decisions reached through collaboration

### Quality Metrics

- **Specification Completeness**: Gaps identified and addressed
- **Team Alignment**: Consensus scores on key requirements
- **Clarity Improvements**: Revisions made based on team feedback
- **Readiness Assessment**: Team confidence in moving to development

## Constraints and Limitations

### What v0 Will NOT Do

- **No AI Integration**: No actual AI processing or generation
- **No Real Data**: No connection to Peak Metrics, Talkwalker, or social APIs
- **No Asset Generation**: No creative production capabilities
- **No Performance Tracking**: No analytics or metrics beyond documentation usage

### v0 Scope Boundaries

- **Focus**: Specification and collaboration only
- **Complexity**: Simple, static-site architecture
- **Timeline**: 4-week maximum development time
- **Resources**: Minimal technical resources required

## Transition to v1

### From v0 to v1

- Use v0 feedback to refine v1 requirements
- Carry forward finalized specifications
- Apply lessons learned about team collaboration needs
- Leverage specification consensus for v1 development priorities

### Knowledge Transfer

- Document all team decisions made during v0
- Catalog specification changes and rationale
- Preserve team discussions for future reference
- Create v1 development brief based on v0 outcomes

This v0 specification provides a clear, bounded scope for creating a collaborative specification platform that will help the team understand, refine, and finalize the HIVE 3.0 requirements before beginning complex development work.
