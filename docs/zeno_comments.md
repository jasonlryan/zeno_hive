Here's a structured review of the comments provided across the sections of your document or platform. I‚Äôve grouped the key themes, summarized the concerns, and offered guidance for next steps.

üîç Key Themes Identified
Theme
Summary
Key Authors
Recommended Actions
AI Use & Human Role
Multiple concerns about positioning AI as supportive rather than a replacement for human creativity.
Stu, Greg
Clarify that AI outputs are stimuli, not final creative. Emphasize human-led ideation and refinement.
Tool Governance & DJE Policy
Requests to ensure all AI tools comply with DJE/Edelman guidance, particularly for image/video gen.
Stu, Greg
Reference DJE-approved tools explicitly. Consider a policy appendix or footnote.
Trend Detection / Alerts
Suggestions to centralize alerts and insights earlier in workflow (e.g., upfront in detection).
Nancy-Elizabeth, Greg, Michael Brito
Move critical detection data (e.g., TikTok/PeakMetrics trends) to the top of the process flow.
Metrics, Triggers, and Reporting
Repeated asks about how things will be measured, triggered, or reported‚Äîespecially alerts and outputs.
Jess, Greg, Brito
Add a reporting/triggering diagram or appendix that explains: how alerts are delivered, metrics tracked, and actions recommended.
Synthetic Personas
Questions around data sourcing and platform (StatSocial) usage.
Nancy-Elizabeth, Brito
Integrate StatSocial workflow or note what audience data is available and where.
Brand Use Case Scope
Concern the examples (e.g., Nike) skew to lifestyle brands. Desire to include corporate/health clients.
Stu, Jess
Add more B2B, tech, and health client examples. A table contrasting use cases across sectors might help.
Platform & Technical Capabilities
Requests for clarity on AI tool output types, DCO potential, API use, and platform selection.
Greg, Jess
Add a "Tech Stack Guide" or chart of tool capabilities and DJE approvals.
Scalability & Customization
Questions about extending formats, scaling assets (e.g., 10‚Üí100), and platform flexibility.
Greg, Jess
Indicate roadmap for scale and allow for modular input/format expansion.
Client Access & Delivery
Mixed opinions about giving clients direct access through HIVE or review environments.
Jess
Clarify when/if/how client-facing interfaces are exposed. Possibly include ‚Äúinternal vs. client-facing‚Äù workflows.

üîß Priority Fixes (High Value / Low Effort)
Clarify AI's Role in Ideation
Emphasize human origination ‚Üí AI enhancement ‚Üí human refinement. Avoid implying that AI generates final concepts.

Add DJE Tool Compliance Notes
Insert callouts or footnotes under each tool listing with a status: ‚úÖ DJE Approved, ‚ö†Ô∏è In Testing, üö´ Not Approved.

Move Detection/Alerts Earlier
Consider an ‚ÄúIntelligence Hub‚Äù slide or section at the front end that consolidates TikTok/PeakMetrics insights, trend alerts, and signals.

Include Trigger + Reporting Mechanics
Visual: flow diagram of how alerts are generated ‚Üí routed ‚Üí acted on. List default metrics tracked.

Broaden Client Examples
Use a simple 2x2 matrix: ‚ÄúFMCG / Tech / Corporate / Health‚Äù vs ‚ÄúUse Case (Detection / Creation / Distribution).‚Äù

‚úèÔ∏è Opportunities for Enrichment
Add an FAQ Section with Qs like:

What tools are DJE-approved?

How do alerts trigger?

Can clients access the platform?

Where does audience data come from?

Insert a glossary to support less technical audiences (e.g., DCO, PeakMetrics, StatSocial, etc.).

Consider a Decision Tree: For teams selecting tools or workflows, a simple conditional flowchart may reduce confusion.

If you'd like, I can create:
A rewritten section based on this feedback

A visual flowchart of alerts and detection

A revised executive summary incorporating tool policy and audience triggers

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.
